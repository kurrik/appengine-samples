INTRO:
------
This is a sample App Engine implementation of a contact list entry form.  It 
should be a suitable base for building a rich AJAX client.

ABOUT:
------
There are 3 main URLs:
  /       - Basic list of data in the data store.
  /form   - An input form for getting data into the app.
  /json   - A JSON representation of the data served at /
  
TO MODIFY:
----------
Put static files in /static and refer to them as /static/myfile.ext

Edit the form and index templates at /templates/form.html and 
/templates/index.html

There is also a JSON feed your JavaScript may reference at /json

TO RUN LOCALLY:
---------------
Obtain the AppEngine SDK from http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html
Install Python if you don't have it
Run:
  dev_appserver.py --port=9999 --address=0.0.0.0 .

From this base directory (note the trailing period).
 
TO DEPLOY:
----------
Change the app name in app.yaml before deploying.  You can register an 
application name at www.appspot.com.
